## Backend technology stack:

## Application specification

- It should be a RESTful API ✅
- You can use https://ipstack.com/ for the geolocation of IP addresses and URLs ✅
- The back-end part of the application can be built in any framework of your choice ✅
- The application should preferably be hosted and available online (for example on Heroku - https://www.heroku.com/free) ✅
- Heroku also provides some free DBs so you can use them ✅
- It is preferable that the API operates using JSON (for both input and output) ✅
- You can create a registration form but using hardcoded values for authorisation is also acceptable (just make sure that API is secured by JWT token) ✅
- Specs, serializers and docker are always welcome! ✅
